This repository contains my solutions and implementations for deep learning homework assignments. It serves as a record of my progress in implementing deep learning.

## About

This repository is a collection of deep learning assignments that I completed as part of my coursework. Each folder corresponds to a different homework assignment and contains the code and documentation related to that assignment.

##  Assignments

Here's a list of the assignments included in this repository:

- **Assignment 1**: Find optimal vector in Poisson regression 
- **Assignment 2**: DNA Sequence Classification using 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks \(CNN\)
- **Assignment 3**: Graph Alignment with Graph Neural Networks \(GNN\)
